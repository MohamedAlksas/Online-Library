# ITI Internship Bookstore Project

Welcome to the Bookstore Web Application! This project was developed as part of my ITI internship, using **ASP.NET MVC** and **Entity Framework**. This app allows users to sign up as either **Authors** or **Users** and provides distinct functionalities for each role.

## Project Features

### User Roles:
1. **Authors**
   - Can add new books to the bookstore.
   - Can view and manage orders related to their books.
   
2. **Users**

   - Can search for authors by name.
   - Can view, edit, or cancel their book orders.

### Screenshots
